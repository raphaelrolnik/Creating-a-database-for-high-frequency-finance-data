This project focuses on the development and backtesting of a high-frequency trading (HFT) strategy applied to the EUR/USD and EUR/GBP currency pairs. The strategy is built using an intrinsic time framework, which provides an alternative method to clock time for analyzing tick data. The project involves the implementation of a trading strategy that evaluates price changes within specific time intervals and triggers buy or sell signals based on predefined thresholds.
